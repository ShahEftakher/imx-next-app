2 types of api calls possible with ImmutableXClient, 
- one initialized only with apiAddress, 
- 2nd with signer, starkContractAddress, registrationContract address. 
 - here signer is created with user pk
 - starkContractAddress is the deployed smart contract
 - registrationContract address is most likely the user registration contract address deployed on L1

Things possible without signer: 
Most probably the collections on the IMX and the listings. Nothing else...
